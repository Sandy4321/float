Title: Single Precision Matrices
Version: 0.1-0
Description: R comes with a suite of utilities for linear algebra with "numeric"
    (double precision) vectors/matrices. However, sometimes single precision
    (or less!) is more than enough for a particular task.  This package extends
    R's linear algebra facilities to include single precision (float) data.
    Float vectors/matrices have half the precision of their "numeric"-type
    counterparts, for a performance vs accuracy tradeoff.  The internal
    representation is an S4 class, which allows us to keep the syntax identical
    to that of base R's.  Interaction between base types for binary operators
    is generally possible.  In these cases, type promotion always defaults to
    the higher precision.  The package ships with copies of the single precision
    BLAS and LAPACK, which are automatically built in the event they are needed.
